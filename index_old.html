<h2>About me</h2>
I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu">Computer Science</a> department of Columbia University, where my adviser is <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/">Prof. Michael Collins</a>. Prior to that, I was a Software Development Engineer at Microsoft for two years, living in Seattle, WA.  I graduated in 2009 from Harvard College, where I majored in Mathematics, with a minor in Computer Science. I am originally from Potomac, MD.<br />
Here is a link to my <a href="files/Avner_May_CV_website.pdf">resume</a> <i>(updated 10/31/2014)</i>.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
My main research areas are in Machine Learning and Speech Recognition.  Specifically, I have been working on acoustic modeling, which is a large-scale multi-class classification problem important in speech recognition systems. Most recently, I have focused on scaling kernel methods to this domain using approximation techniques. Although kernel methods have been extensively studied, and have a strong theoretical foundation, there has been relatively little success scaling these methods to large-scale problems like speech recognition and computer vision. Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) are the state of the art in these domains, even though training them can be quite complicated, they suffer from local-minima, and they are not well-understood theoretically. Thus, I am interested in exploring alternate approaches to DNNs, which would ideally be better understood and involve convex optimization problems.  <br /><br />
Prior to working on machine learning/acoustic modeling, I did two years of research in social network analysis, advised by <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~augustin/">Prof. Augustin Chaintreau</a>; I studied whether social networks like Facebook or Twitter are efficient systems for delivering content of interest to their users (2011-2013).

<h2>Other Interests</h2>
I love most things that involve being active and outdoors - running, biking, snowboarding, hiking, camping, and basically anything in the mountains.  I love fruits and vegetables, and am very interested in food systems and nutrition, and how they affect our health and the environment.  I am very interested in applications of technology and machine learning to domains such as health and education.  I have a 2 year old niece, Aliza, so she is now a big extra-curricular interest of mine.
